<p>Advances in immunology and genetic engineering have led to the development
of promising cellular therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune
diseases, and infectious diseases. However, developers of these complex
"live" therapies are constantly challenged by scalability and high manufacturing
costs.</p>
<p>Agilent's broad technology portfolio enables researchers and manufacturers
to investigate the full range of cellular mechanisms of action, specificity,
efficacy, phenotype, and fate. At every stage from discovery to process
development, relevant critical quality attributes (CQAs) are identified
to ensure that cellular products meet safety and efficacy criteria.</p>
