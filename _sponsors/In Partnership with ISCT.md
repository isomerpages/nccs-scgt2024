<p>Established in 1992, the International Society for Cell &amp; Gene Therapy
(ISCT) is a global society of clinicians, regulators, researchers, technologists,
and industry partners with a shared vision to translate cell and gene therapy
into safe and effective therapies to improve patients' lives worldwide.</p>
<p>ISCT is the global leader focused on pre-clinical and translational aspects
of developing cell and gene-based therapeutics, thereby advancing scientific
research into innovative treatments for patients. ISCT offers a unique
collaborative environment that addresses three key areas of translation:
Academia, Regulatory, and Commercialization. Through strong relationships
with global regulatory agencies, academic institutions, and industry partners,
ISCT drives the advancement of research into a standard of care.</p>
<p>Comprised of over 3,000 cell and gene therapy experts across five geographic
regions and representation from over 60 countries, ISCT members are part
of a global community of peers, thought leaders, and organizations invested
in cell and gene therapy translation.</p>
