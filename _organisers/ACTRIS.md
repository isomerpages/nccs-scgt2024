<p>ACTRIS was established on 20 April 2020 to meet the increasing clinical
demand of using cellular therapeutics to treat various life-threatening
diseases. ACTRISâ€™s vision is to be the national and regional Centre of
Excellence for discovery, process development and manufacturing of cellular-based
therapeutics across the broad spectrum of immunotherapy and regenerative
medicine, encompassing both investigational and approval products for the
local market. ACTRIS aims to achieve accreditation from national and international
regulators to ensure quality compliance of resource-efficient cellular
therapy manufacturing. Our common goal is to promote and foster the entire
value chain of the cellular therapy ecosystem through enabling translational
research and development, manufacturing, clinical service provision and
commercialisation by serving the healthcare, academic and industrial sectors.
ACTRIS will also provide value-added services such as workforce training,
regulatory facilitation and ancillary material standardization pertaining
to delivery of cellular therapy to patients.</p>
