<p>Established in May 2021, Singhealth Duke-NUS Regenerative Medicine Institute
of Singapore (REMEDIS) was set up, to advance the efforts in regenerative
medicine research by exploring the potential of regenerating diseased cells,
tissue and even organs to develop research, regenerative therapies and
tools to tackle age-related diseases and chronic conditions. Regenerative
medicine is expected to have a significant impact in reducing the burden
of age-related and chronic disease.</p>
